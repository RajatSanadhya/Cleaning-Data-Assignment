# Getting and Cleaning Data
This is the submission for the getting and cleaning data project in the "Geetting and Cleaning Data" course by Johns Hopkins University.

# Files
* ```run_analysis.R``` <- This is the main script which performs all the tasks required.
* ```CodeBook.md``` <- This is the code book that describes how the script handles the data at various stages and also illustrates the transformations applied on the data.
* ```README.md``` <- This file.

To run, just clone the repo or download the ```run_analysis.R``` file and execute it. It will automatically download, clean and save the data.
The data will be saved in 2 formats, ```TxT``` and ```CSV```, inside the **Data** folder, so you can choose what works best for you.
